now

1 html files are geting formated with "html"
and
php files are formated with "blade-formater"

both does not give any instant reply on errors but in html formater we can find it with

:ConformInfo

in blade-formater we cant.

so we might need html-ls to work with it.

we can formate inside .php file wht html with <leader> c f

<!--
Y: WARNING:
   with this we will get " name.img" space in double cote problem.
-->

but you can get html errors wihh
:ConformInfo
after <leader>cf and solve the html error and then

<!-- G: save the file which format with "blade-formater" -->

we alos need java formater ni next time
